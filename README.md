## About this project

A template for building @openmcp-project Service Providers.

## Requirements and Setup

1. Create a new repository based on this template.
2. Install opencontrolplane-gen.
3. Run `task template:generate-provider` to generate your `ServiceProvider`.
4. Implement your reconciler logic and run the e2e tests.

Code generation is powered by [`opencontrolplane-gen`](https://github.com/openmcp-project/opencontrolplane-gen), which processes `//go:generate opencontrolplane-gen` directives in the source files. Placeholders (e.g. `Foo`, `foo`) are replaced based on environment variables set by the Task targets.

## Template Taskfiles

This template contains two Taskfiles:

- Taskfile.yaml contains the tasks to use once you created a Service Provider based on this template.
- Taskfile_template.yaml contains the tasks to use while working with the template. This Taskfile can be removed once you used this template to create a Service Provider.

The following sections give a brief overview of the template specific tasks.

### User tasks

To generate a Service Provider, use `task template:generate-provider`:

```shell
task template:generate-provider api=YourKind name=yourname module=github.com/yourorg/yourrepo
```

The following options are available:

| Variable          | Description                                       | Default                                               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `api`             | GVK kind name                                     | `Example`                                             |
| `name`            | Service provider name (used in folder and tasks)  | `example`                                             |
| `module`          | Go module path                                    | `github.com/openmcp-project/service-provider-example` |
| `workloadcluster` | Run on a workload cluster                         | `false`                                               |
| `secretwatcher`   | Include secret watcher implementation             | `false`                                               |
| `samplecode`      | Include sample provider code                      | `false`                                               |
| `dryrun`          | Preview the output without writing files          | `false`                                               |

Then you can run the e2e test to verify that the template rendered a working Service Provider:

```shell
task test-e2e
```

For a detailed guide on setup and usage, please refer to the full [Service Provider Development Guide](https://openmcp-project.github.io/docs/developers/serviceprovider/service-providers).

### Template Development

The following tasks are useful to test any template code changes.

- `template:dev:gen`: Executes the template with the default values to render "service-provider-example" for local development.
- `template:dev:img`: Builds a container image for "service-provider-example". This also includes code validating.
- `template:dev:e2e`: Executes e2e tests for "service-provider-example".

All `template:dev` tasks support the following arguments:

- `debug`: enables debug logs of [opencontrolplane-gen](https://github.com/openmcp-project/opencontrolplane-gen).
- `workloadcluster`: Run on a workload cluster.
- `secretwatcher`: Include secret watcher implementation.
- `samplecode`: Include sample provider code.

### Service Provider Runtime Flags

The generated service provider supports the following runtime flags:

- `--verbosity`: Logging verbosity level (see [controller-runtime logging](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/main/TMP-LOGGING.md))
- `--environment`: Name of the environment (required for operation)
- `--provider-name`: Name of the provider resource (required for operation)
- `--metrics-bind-address`: Address for the metrics endpoint (default: `0`, use `:8443` for HTTPS or `:8080` for HTTP)
- `--health-probe-bind-address`: Address for health probe endpoint (default: `:8081`)
- `--leader-elect`: Enable leader election for controller manager (default: `false`)
- `--metrics-secure`: Serve metrics endpoint securely via HTTPS (default: `true`)
- `--enable-http2`: Enable HTTP/2 for metrics and webhook servers (default: `false`)

For a complete list of available flags, run the generated binary with `-h` or `--help`.
