# service-provider-template

## About this project

A template for building @openmcp-project Service Providers

## Requirements and Setup

1. Create a new repository based on this template.
2. Execute the template to create a new `ServiceProvider`.
3. Test your `ServiceProvider`.

The template includes a basic code generation command that lets you create a `ServiceProvider` for your Go module, API kind and group.
You can also choose to add sample code to get a fully functional `ServiceProvider`.

For a complete usage overview with the default settings, run:

```shell
go run ./cmd/template -h
```

Then execute the template, for example:

```shell
go run ./cmd/template -module github.com/yourorg/yourrepo -kind YourKind -group yourgroup
```

Running End-to-End tests:

```shell
task test-e2e
```
